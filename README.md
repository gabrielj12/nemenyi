# Nemenyi

Library to perform the Friedman statistical test and Nemenyi post-hoc analysis.

## Instalation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gabrieljaguiar/nemenyi.git
```


## Instructions

The input file must be a .csv file, and the output is a .tex file. The columns refer to the algorithms/methods you want to compare and the rows corresponds to the results you have for them. There is a folder with example files, please check them. Also, be aware that if your column names have special characters, you might have to add changes in the .tex file.

The **--h or --l** parameter is used to define if the higher the better or the lower the better. The last parameter is optional, if you want to skip the first column of the dataset, sometimes used for identification of the sample.

```bash
python nemenyi.py examples/input.csv examples/output.tex --h [--ignore_first_column]
```

In the latex file, do not forget to add the following lines before the beginning of the document:

```bash
\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.pathmorphing}
```

## Requirements

The following Python packages are required.

* pandas
* numpy
* scipy

Also, use Python **3.6**!
